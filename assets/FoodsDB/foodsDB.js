        title: 'How to Cook Pancit Canton',
        content: `Here is a summary of what I did to achieve this delicious and tasty pancit canton.

        I started by preparing the vegetables. Blanch the snap peas, carrot, and cabbage. Blanching is a cooking method that retains the texture and color of vegetables. Do this by first preparing a large bowl that can accomodate all the vegetables. Fill half of it with cold water and add ice. Set the bowl aside. Meanwhile boil water on a cooking pot and put all the veggies in there. Boil for less than a minute (around 50 seconds) and then transfer the veggies to the bowl with ice water. The temperature of the water stops the vegetable from cooking further.This helps make the veggies crisp and retain its color. Set the vegetables aside. These will be added back towards the end of the process.
        
        Saute onion and garlic until soft. Add the meat and continue to cook until the color turns light brown. You can add seasonings and chicken broth. Let boil and continue to cook with the pot covered until the meats are tender.

        The shrimp and chopped parsley goes next. These cooks quickly. Add the noodles afterwards and cover the pot. Let the noodles absorb the steam. This makes it softer. Toss the noodles and continue to cook until the liquid is completely absorbed. You may want to add more water if the noodles seem dry.

        Finish it by adding back the blanched vegetables and seasoning with ground black pepper. Toss until all ingredients are well distributed.`,

        title: 'Alternative Ingredients for Pancit Canton',
        content: `There are many ways to cook pancit canton. The difference between each version has something to do with the main ingredients used.

        You can use snow peas a a substitute for snap peas. These are called chicharo in Filipino.
        
        • Chicken can also be a good alternative to pork.
        • The oyster sauce is an optional ingredient. I like it because it improves the flavor of pancit canton.
        • Sliced long green beans can be added to the dish.
        • Napa cabbage can be used as an alternative ingredient to regular cabbage.`,
      },

        title: 'Pancit Canton Versions',
        content: `Vegetarian – This version is vegetarian and vegan friendly. It had the basic ingredients with the addition of Shiitake mushroom. This is a flavorful mushroom variety that I used most of the time when cooking Asian dishes.
        
        Instant – There was a time when instant pancit canton was a staple because of its price and ease of preparation. However, this is not the healthiest food that you can make for yourself or your family. I developed this recipe to introduce a healthier instant pancit canton by adding vegetables.

        Shrimp – I like to have shrimp in my doodle dish. It provides a good flavor and is always pleasant to eat. This particular version makes use of frozen shrimp along with bell peppers. It is one of my go to recipe when I feel like making a quick one with limited time.

        Shrimp and Chicken – A combination of shrimp and chicken for a noodle dish is always a good idea. This recipe has shredded chicken and pan-fried shrimp. I also had some Chinese sausage in it to lift the overall flavor to the next level.

        Squid Ball – Chow mein with squid ball is a budget-friendly dish. It is composed of the same flour noodles with vegetables such as cabbage and carrots. A popular Filipino street food known as squid balls are utilized. A squid ball is a ball-shaped mixture with either fresh chopped squid or squid flavor.

        Seafood – One of my favorite version is seafood. It has shrimp, squid, crabmeat, squiballs, and mushroom. I think that this is one of the tastiest noodle dish that I made. It is perfect during lent when Catholics are abstaining from meat.

        Saucy – Pancit canton with extra sauce is always good to have. There are even times when I eat it with rice. It might sound unusual, but the flavorful sauce always complement whatever dish or side dish you eat it with. I like mine with more calamansi, so I squeeze a piece of it over the pancit before eating.

        Pancit Canton and Bihon – another version of pancit canton that is famous in Cebu and its nearby provinces is called Bam-I. It is a combination of both flour sticks and rice stick noodles. Any topping ingredient can be used to make this version. The key here to be able to cook both noodles properly and distribute it evenly to make the dish look good.`,

      {
        title: 'What is the Best Condiment for Pancit Canton?',
        content: `The best condiment for pancit canton for me is a mixture composed of soy sauce and calamansi. It is also known as “toyomansi”.

        Calamansi or calamondin is a citrus fruit. It is smaller than lime and has a sour and a bit bitter taste. Lemon and lime can also be used a substitutes when calamansi is not available.
        
        Simply pour a tablespoons or two of toyomansi on your noodle dish and toss until well blended. Yummy!`,

        title: 'What is a Pancit Palabok',
        content: `Pancit Palabok is a variation of pancit, a classic dish many Filipinos enjoy. Despite the many different kinds of pancit in the country, palabok is easily recognized by certain trademark characteristics: its thin noodles and orange sauce in particular. Some say that one synonym of palabok is “salsa na malapot” –– meaning, a sauce that is gooey and viscous in nature.
        
        However, the orange color of palabok’s sauce doesn’t come from the orange fruit; instead, palabok sauce is usually a combination of pork broth, shrimp cubes, ground pork, and annatto powder. The latter is the reason behind these noodles’ bright and refreshing appearance.

        Aside from its appearance, what sets pancit palabok apart from other popular pancit variations? Let’s find out.`,
      },
      {
        title: 'What is the difference between Pancit Malabon and Palabok?',
        content: `Tasty and true to its name, Pancit Malabon hails from –– you guessed it –– the city of Malabon! Its bright appearance bears a resemblance to that of Pancit Palabok; the use of hard boiled eggs, chicharon, and shrimp, too, cannot be discounted. Many people consider Pancit Palabok and Pancit Malabon to be one and the same because of this.

        However, one of the biggest differences lies in the type of noodles we use in each kind of pancit. In Pancit Palabok, the noodles are much thinner. The typical noodle of choice is bihon, which are almost clear in nature and known for their narrowness. Meanwhile, Malabon’s noodles are considerably thicker.
        
        Another difference is the toppings. Pancit Malabon tends to use more seafood, like shrimp, squid –– even oysters at times! While palabok has shrimps, too, that’s typically as far as seafood toppings go for this kind of pancit. When serving palabok, one usually only puts the toppings and sauce atop the noodles instead of mixing them. With Pancit Malabon, on the other hand, the ingredients, toppings, and sauce are more incorporated.`,

      {
        title: 'What makes Pancit Malabon different from Pancit Luglug?',
        content: `Essentially, Pancit Luglug is just the Kapampangan version of Pancit Palabok. From the toppings all the way down to its special sauce, Luglug looks even more similar to Palabok than Pancia Malabon does.

        However, the difference, once again, is in the noodles! Luglug is actually a term that refers specifically to the method of cooking thick rice noodles. While some say that you can make pancit luglug with both thick or thin noodles, it is more common to use the former rather than the latter.`,
      },
      {
        title: 'How to Cook Pancit Palabok',
        content: `Making Pancit Palabok is usually divided into two portions: making the sauce and making the toppings. Altogether, cooking and prep time shouldn’t take longer than 45 minutes! In no time at all, you’ll have enough Pancit Palabok to feed your whole family. 

        Your sauce ingredients don’t require a lot of preparation beforehand, but your toppings sure do. Boil 1 cup of pork, then thinly slice and cut it into small pieces. Cube 2 pieces of fried firm tofu, pound half a cup of chicharon, and slice 2 hard boiled eggs. Don’t forget to boil or steam your shrimp (about half a cup) then finely chop your green onions or scallions.
        
        All ready? Let’s start cooking! Soak 1 pack of rice noodles in water for about 15 minutes. Afterwards, drain them and set it aside. We’ll be focusing on the sauce portion of your pancit palabok first; begin by heating some cooking oil in a saucepan. Once your oil is hot enough, pour in half a pound of ground pork, letting it cook for about 5 to 7 minutes. 
        
        Take your tablespoon of annatto powder and dilute it in 3 cups of pork broth. If you’re using annatto seeds, it’s important to soak them first in 3 tablespoons of water to bring out the palabok’s trademark color. Pour this mixture into a saucepan and bring it to a boil. Add your shrimp cube and stir, letting the sauce simmer for about 3 minutes. Little by little, pour in, too, your 6 tablespoons of all purpose flour. Stir your pancit palabok sauce gradually as you do so. Add 2 tablespoons of fish sauce and half a teaspoon of ground black pepper and let your sauce simmer until it becomes thick. Once it has, turn the heat off and set it aside. 
        
        With your sauce out of the way, let’s now prepare the rest of your pancit! Boil enough water in a pot. Then, take your noodles and put them in a strainer (metal or bamboo), then submerge said strainer in the boiling water. This should only take about a minute or so, until the noodles are cooked. Remove the strainer from the pot, and drain the remaining water.
        
        Now it’s time to prepare your pancit palabok serving plate! Place the noodles first before pouring the sauce over them thoroughly. Arrange your toppings –- your tofu, your chicharon, your shrimp, eggs, and others –– around the plate, and over the sauce. Last but not the least, give your pancit palabok that zesty flavor with a slice of lemon or calamansi.`,

      {
        title: `How to Cook Sisig`,
        content: `Start to cook sisig by boiling the meat. I boiled the pork belly and maskara for 1 hour in medium heat. The meat needs to be tenderized so that it will be easier to chop later on.

        I also grill the meat after boiling. This will give it a good texture. There are no marinades or rubs needed here. Simply put the boiled pork belly and maskara on a hot grill, and then grill each side for 5 minutes or until is starts to darken.
        
        It is chopping time at this point. Simply chop the belly and pig face into small pieces. I use a knife known as a cleaver to assist me in this step. It weighs heavy enough and has a sharp cutting edge that helps me chop easily. The size of the chopped pork will depend on your preference. You can go a bit bigger or chop it as fine as it can get depending on your preference. Set the meat aside after this step. It is time to cook it on the stovetop.

        I started by sautéing the onions. Chicken livers were added afterwards. These steps can be interchanged just so you know. Let me explain. Chicken liver is an essential ingredient for my sisig recipes. It provides a good amount of flavor to the dish. These can be chopped or sliced into smaller pieces before cooking. I am just not used in doing that, but you can. What I do is to cook it thoroughly and mash it right on the pan while cooking. These livers are easier to mash when thoroughly cooked, unlike pork or beef liver, which tend to get tougher. You can fry the chicken liver first until cooked all throughout. This will usually take 5 minutes. The other option is to do it as this recipe suggest. An easier option for beginners would be to chop the livers into small pieces before cooking. This makes mashing it easier.

        Add the chopped pork into the mix. These do not need to cook long. Give it a nice stir for around 3 minutes just to ensure that all ingredients in the pan are distributed evenly. Add seasonings and spices afterwards. You have the option to add chili flakes at this point. Note that I am using Knorr Liquid Seasoning to provide additional flavor to the dish. It can provide a good amount of flavor compared to regular soy sauce.

        The final texture of sisig is somewhat mushy. Pig brains are added into the mixture in traditional recipes to obtain this. Good news! There are alternative ingredients. Mayonnaise is one. This is what I used in this recipe.
        
        A good way to present sisig is to put it on a metal plate and serve while sizzling. This makes the dish more appetizing to the eye. This is optional.`,
      },
      {
        title: `Alternative Ingredients`,
        content: `Pig face and ears are the traditional ingredients for sisig. This recipe is using an alternative ingredient in the form of pork belly. Pork shoulders can also be used in this recipe.

        Chicken sisig is a good version that can be made using this recipe. Substitute chopped chicken thighs for the pork. Make sure that the chicken was boiled the same way before chopping it.
        
        Fish sisig and tofu sisig are versions of the dish that are done differently. These can be good alternative dishes for non-pork eaters.`,

    description: `Chicken Adobo is a type of Filipino chicken stew. Chicken pieces are marinated in soy sauce and spices, pan-fried, and stewed until tender. The dish gained popularity because of its delicious taste and ease in preparation.
    
    A dish that is classically and quintessentially Pinoy, chicken adobo is a dish that is beloved by many across the country. While there have been several variations of adobo across the years, chicken adobo remains one of the most popular –– and for good reason!

    The taste of juicy chicken in a succulent, umami adobo sauce makes chicken adobo a comfort food for all ages. From kids to adults, we can’t get enough of this mouthwatering meal!`,

        title: `What is Chicken Adobo`,
        content: `A dish and cooking process native to the Philippines, adobo refers to the method of marinating meat, seafood, or vegetables (pretty much anything!) in a combination of soy sauce and vinegar. This marinade also includes other herbs and flavorings like garlic, bay leaves, and whole peppercorns.

        Cooking food in vinegar is no foreign concept to us Filipinos. In pre-colonial times, our ancestors used to cook seafood in vinegar in order to preserve their freshness. Many regard adobo as a spin on kinilaw, which is another traditional cooking method. Kinilaw refers mainly to cooking raw seafood in vinegar and spices. Another similar process is paksiw, which utilizes meat broth in vinegar and spices.
        
        What really sets adobo apart is the presence of soy sauce in its marinade. While vinegar has a pungent aroma and a very distinctly sour taste, soy sauce is on both the sweeter and saltier side. A staple in any Asian household, soy sauce (or toyo) definitely helps in bringing out chicken adobo’s savory taste.

        (Here’s a fun fact: did you know that there are different kinds of soy sauce? In Japan especially, there are five different kinds of soy sauce that each have their own unique flavors and uses. The most common one you’ll find in markets is dark soy sauce, or koikuchi. With a deeper color than most other types, dark soy sauce is packed with flavor –– perfect for your chicken adobo!)

        Adobo also contains dry bay leaves in its recipe. Although you aren’t to eat them whole, bay leaves lend their subtle, deep flavors to this umami dish. It may not be the star of the show, but your chicken adobo wouldn’t be complete without it. However, you can choose to substitute this herb with basil if you can’t find it at stores.`,

        title: `Chicken Adobo Origin`,
        content: `The famous Chicken Adobo originated in the Philippines. The dish is prepared using the Inadobo style of cooking. It means cooking meat or seafood with vinegar and mostly soy sauce. It is a popular method during the olden days when refrigerators and freezers were not yet available because vinegar helps extend the shelf life of food. Another popular variation is pork adobo using pork belly.`,
      },
      {
        title: `How to Cook Chicken Adobo`,
        content: `Cooking Chicken Adobo is quick and simple. This recipe suggests marinating the chicken to make it more flavorful. It is the best way to go if you want to experience authentic Filipino chicken adobo. If you are in a hurry, feel free to skip this step, but make sure to simmer the chicken longer than 30 minutes to better extract the flavors from it.
        
        Start by marinating the chicken in soy sauce and garlic. The garlic needs to be crushed for best results. This process takes 1 hour to 12 hours depending on how flavorful you want the dish to be. Sometimes marinating for an hour is not enough. I think that 3 hours is optimal. The chicken absorbs most of the flavors from the soy sauce and garlic during this step. It is noticeable when you taste the dish after cooking. Note that it is also possible to include the vinegar in this step.
        
        The next step is to separate the chicken from the marinade. Make sure to set the marinade aside because it will be used later on. Pan-fry the chicken pieces for 1 to 1 ½ minutes per side. This will partially cook the outer part. It also makes the skin tough enough to withstand stewing later. This means that it will remain intact, which is nice for presentation.

        Pour marinade into the pot and add water. Let boil. The bay leaves and whole peppercorn can now be added. The process takes 20 to 25 minutes depending on the quality of the chicken. However, feel free to cook longer in low heat for a super tender chicken adobo.

        Add the vinegar. This can also be added as a part of the marinade. Let it cook for 10 minutes and then add sugar and salt. I only add salt if needed. It is important to taste your dish before adding seasonings.

        Filipino chicken adobo can be served with or without sauce. If you like it very tasty then continue to cook on an uncovered cooking pot until the liquid completely evaporates.`,

        The lumpia wrapper used in this recipe is store-bought. I will talk more about it later. By the way, eggs are used when making the lumpia filling in order to bind all the ingredients together. It prevents the meat mixture from falling apart or separate from each other when frying.`,

        Let’s talk about the first step. You can simply add all the ingredients in a bowl and mix thoroughly. It can be done the manual way using your hands. An easier way is to use a stand mixer. Make sure to attach the dough hook when going this route.
        
        This is a basic recipe. It will give you a good tasting lumpia. However, you can play around with it by adding more ingredients to bring it up to the next level. A good example is the addition of seasonings to bring-in more flavors. Another good suggestion is to add a bit of Italian sausage to the mixture. You can also try adding veggies such as celery.
        
        Wrapping lumpia is easy. It is something that you can get used to after a few tries. The tricky part in this process is when using a wide wrapper. The video below shows my technique on how to wrap lumpia using wide egg roll wrappers. It is quick and easy. You should try it for yourself.

        Deep frying the lumpia has a little trick in order to ensure that the filling gets completely cooked while not getting the wrapper burnt. It has something to do with temperature. Make sure that you do not fry the lumpia on very hot oil. This will quickly brown the wrapper while leaving the meat mixture still under cooked. Try to fry the lumpia while the oil is starting to get hot, around 250 F. Let it slowly cook the inside. The wrapper will gradually brown as it fries. You will know that it is ready when it floats. By the way, I am assuming that you will follow my lead by also deep frying the egg rolls.

        When it comes to the dipping sauce, I love to dip mine in sweet and sour sauce. Banana sauce or banana ketchup works too.`,

        title: `Cooking Lumpia in an Air Fryer`,
        content: `Using an air fryer is also a good way to cook lumpia without using oil. In fact, it is a healthier option. I usually set the temperature to 370F and air fry my lumpia for 12 minutes. The cooking time can be extended depending on how well you want your food done.
        
        The oil from the ground pork also gets extracted during the cooking process. You will end up with less oil crispy lumpia to munch on.

        When using an air frying to cook my lumpia, I usually spray a small amount of cooking oil on the wrapper. This makes it less dry. It depends on ones preference.`,

    description: `Lumpia or Lumpiang Shanghai is a Filipino egg roll dish. The filling or meat mixture is mainly composed of ground pork, minced carrots, and minced onion. Spices and seasonings are added into the mixture. It is then wrapped and rolled individually in thin flour sheets known as lumpia wrappers.
    
    Each piece of lumpia is deep fried until golden brown. This makes it crunchy and more enjoyable to eat. It is served with either sweet and sour sauce, or with banana ketchup.
    
    Lumpia is a popular dish in the Philippines. It is served during special occasions. Christmas dinner won’t be complete without this on the table. It is also a popular part of the menu during town fiestas, birthday parties, and weddings. It is best eaten with warm white rice. I personally enjoy eating it with Pancit Canton.`,

        title: `Cooking Lumpia`,
        content: `There are three major steps in making lumpia. The first is to make the meat mixture by combining and mixing all the filling ingredients. This involves ground pork, minced veggies, and seasonings. It can be done manually by hand or by the use of a tool such as a spatula, or mechanically using a stand mixer. It is important that all the ingredients are properly blended together to balance the flavor.

        The next step involves wrapping the meat mixture in lumpia wrappers. These are thin sheets made from wheat flour. There are several ways to do this. Make sure to watch the video below to see how I wrapped the lumpia for this recipe. It is a good piece of information especially for newbies in cooking Filipino food.
        
        The last and final step is to fry the lumpia. Deep-frying is recommended for best results. The Lumpiang Shanghai is simply fried until it turns golden brown.`,

        title: `Alternative Ingredients`,
        content: `Pork is the main protein used in making this dish. Ground chicken and fish flakes can also be utilized. Ground beef might work for some people, but it is something that I do not recommend.

        Additional ingredients can also be added. I sometimes add minced singkamas to the meat mixture. Adding chopped green onions is also a good idea.
        
        There are different kinds lumpia wrappers available in the market. The one used in this recipe are called spring roll wrappers. These are the ones traditionally used in the Philippines. Other thicker wrappers such as egg roll wrappers can also be used.`,
      },
      {
        title: `Tips and Tricks`,
        content: `The best lumpia are the ones that are crispy on the outside and cooked well in the inside. This means that the wrapper should be golden brown and crunchy and the meat mixture should be completely done.
        
        It is important to be always aware of the temperature of oil while frying lumpia. Do not use high heat. It will quickly cook the wrapper while leaving the meat mixture inside incompletely cooked. I always recommend setting the heat between low to medium. It will cook the filling while the wrapper slowly gets browned.

        Deep-frying the lumpia yields the best results. It ensures that all the sides of the spring rolls are cooked equal. It also saves you the effort of turning each piece over, compared when using lesser oil. This recommendation might not be ideal if you want to lessen your oil usage for budget reasons. It is up to you.

        It is best to enjoy this with sweet and sour sauce. This classic recipe might be useful. Dipping lumpia in ketchup or in a mixture of soy sauce and calamansi works too.`,

    One of the great things about food is its ever-evolving nature, and how it usually adjusts to the place where it is eaten. As such, did you know that our favorite Caldereta is actually a local adaptation of a Spanish dish? But like many of the recipes we’ve grown to love and adopt in our cuisine, this dish has faced many adjustments. And not only is it fitted to our local palate, but it’s also used ingredients more accessible to us, hence the birth of Pork Caldereta.`,

    description: `Kare Kare is a type of Filipino stew with a rich and thick peanut sauce. It is a popular dish in the Philippines served during special occasions. The traditional recipe is composed of ox tail. There are instances wherein both ox tripe and tail are used. The vegetable components of the dish are string beans, eggplant, bok choy, and banana blossoms. Lightly browned toasted ground rice is used to thicken the sauce.
    
    Palayok or clay pot is used to cook this dish. It also functions as the serving bowl at the same time.The best way to eat kare-kare is to pair it with plain white rice. Bagoong alamang or fermented shrimp paste completes the dish by providing flavor. Simply combine a spoonful of rice and kare-kare with a small portion of bagoong and enjoy!`,

        content: `There are three main processes: tenderize the meat, make the sauce, and prepare the vegetables.
        
        Prepare the meat by boiling it along with chopped onion. This will make it tender while providing flavor at the same time. Oxtail needs to be very tender for best results. It takes around 3 hours to boil when cooking using the traditional method. A quicker way is to use a pressure cooker. It cuts the cooking time by more than half.
        
        The peanut sauce can make or break your dish. It is important to have the proper ratio of ingredients to be able to achieve the ideal consistency of the sauce. It should not be too thick or very thin. I use both peanut butter and crushed peanuts to make the sauce. It provides a rich flavor to it. Annatto seeds make the color of the sauce reddish. You will need to extract the color from the seed by soaking it in warm water for around 12 minutes. The colored water is used to make the dish, not the seed. Discard the seed after use. Thicken the sauce with toasted ground rice.
        
        Vegetable is an important component of kare kare. It can be cooked with the meat or it can be added when serving the dish. I opted to cook the vegetables separately by sautéing with garlic.`,

        Make sure to monitor the amount of water when boiling using the traditional method. Pour more water as needed until the meat tenderizes completely.
        
        Bagoong alamang or shrimp paste is an essential component of the dish. It should be cooked completely before serving. Refer to this bagoong recipe for guidance. You can also purchase precooked bottled bagoong alamang from the supermarket.`,

        title: `Souring Agents for Sinigang`,
        content: `The quality of this dish depends on the souring agent. This is the ingredient that makes the soup sour. The most common and widely used is unripe tamarind. It is known as sampaloc in the Philippines. Other fruits such as guava, tomato, bilimbi or kamias, green mango, pineapple, and wild mangosteen or santol can be used to make the sinigang taste sour.
        
        Of the many soups and stews that proliferate Filipino cuisine, it can be sure that sinigang has no rival. Many meals, both in childhood and adulthood, have been spent sitting in front of the familiarly flavorful broth. Its inviting aroma belies a flavor unlike no other — tart, savory, and refreshing, one can’t help but fall in love with it! With many heralding it as the national Filipino food, it comes as no surprise that its reputation has spread far and wide across the world.

        Indeed, in 2021, travel guide TasteAtlas proclaimed our humble dish to be the best vegetable soup in the world! This should come as no surprise to us, either. After all, who can resist the warmth and comfort that a bowl of sinigang brings? Although a staple so common in every household, knowing that sinigang will be the main course of the day can’t help but elicit feelings of excitement and delight. No matter the weather nor the season, sinigang stands both the test of time and climate. This dish brings pleasure wherever it finds a home, and Filipinos continue to relish in its sour, but yummy taste.`,
      },
      {
        title: `Where does sinigang come from?`,
        content: `A mix of tender meat, fresh spinach, string beans, and tomatoes, as well as a dash (or more) of savory fish sauce, make for the perfect combination in simmering and incorporating each unique flavor with each other. Powerful and poignant, sinigang is a Filipino native, through and through. Its name, sinigang, originates from the Tagalog verb that directly translates to “to stew” — sigang! Because of its Tagalog name, many presume it to be Tagalog in origin as well. This yummy meal has relatives in other regions in the country as well, to be sure — yet none are quite like this classic soup that many have fallen in love with.

        Again, sinigang isn’t a dish so much as it is a cooking method. This is why, like we mentioned earlier, there are a wide number of variations of this delicious dish! These include your sinigang na hipon, a favorite seafood variant. Here, tender and fresh shrimp soak up all the vibrant flavors of your beloved stew. It’s important to keep your shrimp perfectly cooked, so it’s much easier to peel the skin off later on.`,
      },
      {
        title: `How to Cook Sinigang`,
        content: `Pork Sinigang is delicious and easy to prepare. Note that this recipe will require to saute the onion and pork. Start by heating cooking oil in a cooking pot. Saute the onion until it gets soft. Add the sliced pork. We are using pork belly (or liempo) for this recipe. You may also use other pork slices such as shoulders or parts with bones. Add some fish sauce and continue to cook until the pork turns light brown.

        It is time to add the liquid. This recipe calls for water. You may want to use half water and half beef broth if you prefer your sinigang to be really flavorful. Let the liquid boil and then add the tomato and taro (gabi). The tomato needs to blend in with the broth while the taro will need to cook for a longer time so that it will start to release starch that will make the soup thicker.
        
        The souring agent for this recipe is a tamarind soup base mix, which is more popularly known as  sinigang mix. This is a quicker alternative to fresh tamarind and it will save you time. Add the mix once meat is tender. Add some long green chili, if desired. This will make your soup spicy good. Add the rest of the vegetables towards the last few minutes. Make sure to add the spinach last.

        This is best served with a condiment composed of fish sauce and lots of hot chili pepper.`,
      },
      {
        title: `Sinigang Alternative Ingredients`,
        content: `This sinigang version makes use of pork belly. Any cuts of pork can be used to make it. Beef and fish can also be utilized.

        I am using spinach in this recipe. It is actually an alternative ingredient to kangkong (water spinach), which is the most common type of leafy green vegetable used when cooking sinigang.
        
        Sinigang mix is a powdered product that helps bring-in that good sour taste to sinigang. Old school methods requires boiling either fresh young tamarind or bilimbi for a long time until the flavors are extracted. It is your choice. It is a no-brainer, so I chose flavor and convenience.`,
      },
      {
        title: `Tips in Cooking Pork Sinigang`,
        content: `Make sure to cook the pork until very tender. I really mean it. You don’t want to challenge yourself by chewing the meat with all your might while the nice hot broth slowly cools down. Otherwise, enjoy the broth first before working on the meat.
        
        Onion and tomato brings-in flavor to the broth. Cook it during the initial steps. Some people like their tomato intact. If you are one of these people, I suggest to cook half of the tomato initially and add the remaining once the dish is almost done.

        You can still make sinigang even without all the vegetable in the list. All you need is pork, green leafy veggies, and the souring agent. Of course, water is essential for this recipe.

        Busy people can use a slow cooker to cook sinigang. Make sure to add the spinach or kangkong only when you are about to eat. It is best to have these fresh.`,
      },
      {
        title: `Is sinigang really the national dish of the Philippines?`,
        content: `Though many make jokes and proclamations to the same effect, the truth of the matter is that sinigang is only the Philippine’s national dish unofficially. Regardless, some dishes may also rise to the challenge of national dish, and have separate camps of their own! Let’s take a look at some of them now.

        For starters, of course, you have sinigang’s topmost competition: adobo! Point blank, adobo is perhaps sinigang’s antithesis: where the latter is sour and tart and soupy, adobo is a salty, savory and saucy dish. The only thing they have in common is their use of juicy and tender pork belly as the main protein. Like sinigang, the term adobo refers to a general cooking method, and not necessarily one particular meal. To adobo something means to marinate it in a combination of soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, and peppercorn. These flavors intermingle so perfectly, you wouldn’t be able to tell one from the other. The result is, to be sure, a dish that is so umami you’d want to drizzle the sauce over your entire plate of rice!`,

This delicious dessert is known throughout the world.It has been a regular item in the  menu of most restaurants because of its taste, ease in preparation and long shelf life. It can also be added as a component to build other great tasting dessert creations.`,

        title: `What is the difference between Leche flan and creme caramel?`,
        content: `It is a classic Filipino dish that was adopted from the creme caramel of European origins. However, there is a difference between these desserts. Leche flan, for one, does not use cream. And it mainly relies on evaporated milk and condensed milk for the creamy flavor. You also use condensed milk to add a level of sweetness aside from the sugar in the recipe. Furthermore, creme caramel tastes lighter. While Leche flan, at its best and most authentic, usually tastes a bit heavier, with a rich flavor.

        You make this with the process of baking caramel on the bottom of a custard mold. And it is a sweet custard dessert that leaves you wanting more. This is because other than the fact that it is delectably inviting in its rich, sugary flavor, it is traditionally served in a llanera. And while this oblong metal container is very convenient for the baking process, its small size often results in careful division of the dessert among a group of people who want to share the popular custard.`,
      },
      {
        title: `Where did Leche flan actually come from?`,
        content: `In the 1500s, the Spanish colonized the Philippines. Because of their rule spanning for about 300 years, the Spanish influences had permeated themselves in many parts of Philippine culture. And this, of course, includes the cooking.

        During the Spanish colonization, several Catholic missionaries came over to build churches in the Philippines. And they largely used egg whites to build msot of these churches. This is because they can be a strong adhesive when mixed with quicklime. But because of the widespread usage of egg whites, they had to find ways to utilize the egg yolks left behind.
        
        Of course, one of the essential ingredients of a leche flan are the egg yolks. And this was how the dish was born. With leche meaning milk, the original term for the dessert was actually Leche de flan. The direct translation for this was “flan milk”. With time, they shortened the term to leche flan. And the chilled custard with caramelized sugar became even more popular with time.
        
        Soon, the American colonization took place, which also brought about some changes for the Leche flan. Because of the arrival of canned food products, such as canned condensed milk and canned evaporated milk, most recipes now call for these ingredients strongly to create a classic Leche flan. This resulted in the largely rich, and dense taste and texture of the dessert we now know and love.`,
      },
      {
        title: `How to Cook Leche Flan`,
        content: `Making your own leche flan can be easy if you follow the recipe below and watch the cooking video. Start by beating the egg yolks in a mixing bowl. You can do it the manual way using a fork or use a hand mixer or a stand mixer. Ensure that the eggs are smooth. Gradually add the milk. Start with the condensed milk followed by the fresh milk and vanilla extract. Continue to beat all the ingredients in the bowl until these are well blended. Set this aside for the meantime while you prepare for the next process.

        Grab your llanera or baking pan and place some sugar on it. Heat it over a stove top while holding the pan. Wear oven gloves to protect your hands. You will need to heat it until the sugar melts and turns into caramel. Once the happens, spread the caramel evenly on the llanera or mold that you are using. Slowly add the mixture into each mold and then cover the mold with foil.
        
        The last process is to steam the mold. Simply arrange all the mold in a steamer and steam for a good 30 minutes or so until the mixture turns into yummy flan. At this point, you will decide if you want to dig in right away, or let it cook down a bit.`,

Dredge the banana in sugar until completely coated. You may use either brown or white sugar. Arrange the banana on a lumpia wrapper and place the jackfruit slices on top of the banana. Secure the filling by wrapping. Refer to the video below on how to wrap turon. Perform this step until all the bananas are completely consumed.
        
        The next step is to fry the banana lumpia until golden brown. However, there is an extra step to do in order to achieve the glaze on the outer part. The secret is to first pour the remaining sugar in hot oil. Wait for the sugar to melt completely, and then start to fry the wrapped bananas in batches. The caramel (melted sugar) should automatically stick on the wrapper as you fry.  Remove the fried turon from the pan, and then let the excess oil drip. Let is cool down for 5 minutes before eating.`,

    description: `Tocino is a cured meat product native to the Philippines. It is sometimes referred to as sweet red pork. The curing preparation for this pork dish is similar to that of ham and bacon, except that red food coloring is needed to for this Filipino cured meat.
    
    It was said to be named after the Spanish word “tocino”, which is used to describe cured meats.`,

        title: `Pork Tocino Alternative Ingredients`,
        content: `This recipe is also applicable with other types of meat. Chicken tocino is a popular version next to pork. Beef slices can also be used to make beef tocino.

        There is no direct alternative to the curing ingredients when making authentic tocino. However, you can make another dish with somewhat similar flavor by initially boiling the pork slices in pineapple juice, sugar, a few pinches of salt, and a piece of star anise. Continue boiling until the liquid evaporates. Quickly fry the meat for 1 minute per side.
        
        This version is ideal for those who prefer to make tocino the natural way. It might not look and taste exactly the same, but it is good in its own right.
        
        Pork Tocino is usually eaten during breakfast along with warm rice. Tosilog is a popular meal comprised of garlic rice (or sinangag), fried pork tocino, and a piece of fried sunny side up egg.

        One word of advice though, even how good cured meat tastes, moderate consumption is still recommended. Too much intake can still affect our health in the long run. It is best to have pork tocino at least once or twice per month. By the way, it tastes best when dipped in spicy vinegar.`,

        title: `What is Lechon Kawali`,
        content: `Crispy deep-fried pork is the simplest way to describe lechon kawali. Pork belly or liempo is the cut of pork usually used to cook it. This dish is best served for lunch or dinner with white rice on the side. It is also nice to have with dipping sauce.

        This dish should not be mistaken with Lechon, which is considered as the national dish of the Philippines. Both dishes are prepared in a different manner. These also have different visual appearance.
        
        Lechon kawali got its name from the type of cooking pan that is traditionally used to cook it, the Kawali. It is the typical pan that can be found in almost all Filipino household. This is the “goto” pan in everyday cooking.`,
      },
      {
        title: `How to Cook Lechon Kawali`,
        content: `There are two processes involved in cooking lechon kawali. The first process involves boiling the pork belly, while the next is deep-frying until the skin becomes crispy.

        Let’s talk about the boiling process first. This is necessary to achieve that crispy skin result. Simply frying pork without boiling will have a different outcome.
        
        It is important that the pork belly gets really tender during this step. Start by boiling water in a deep cooking pot. I also add salt and other seasonings. The flavors are absorbed by the pork while boiling. The minimum amount of time is 30 minutes. Feel free to go beyond this time as necessary. This is also the same process when making crispy pata.
        
        Deep-frying the pork belly makes the skin golden brown and crispy. Do this by heating oil on a deep cooking pot. Make sure to rub salt all over the boiled pork belly before frying. It helps provide more flavor.
        
        Carefully put a piece of pork belly into the pan with hot oil and put your guard up always by holding the cover of the pot. Partially cover as necessary when hot oil starts to splatter. Covering the pot totally is not recommended because it traps the steam which forms into water. This causes oil to splatter more when it drips from the base of the cover. Cook in medium heat until the pork belly is crispy. Here is a good forum that talks more about preventing oil from splattering when frying.
        
        It is recommended to turn the pork belly over to complexly fry the opposite side when not enough oil is used. This way, your lechon kawali is cooked uniformly.

        Place the deep-fried pork on a wire rack and let it cook down. Chop into serving pieces. This is best served with lechon sauce. You can also use a mixture of soy sauce and calamansi as dipping sauce.`,

        title: `What is Tapsilog?`,
        content: `The word Tapsilog is an acronym that stands for Tapa Sinangag at Itlog. These are the three components of the meal. Tapa refers to beef tapa. This are fried marinated beef slices.

        Sinangag, on the other hand, is a word used to refer to garlic fried rice. The last three letters of the word tapsilog is derived from the filipino translation for egg, which is itlog. A piece of egg is fried and forms part of the meal.`,
      },
      {
        title: `How to Cook Tapsilog`,
        content: `Since Tapsilog is composed of three components, each has to be prepared and cooked individually.

        The beef needs to be marinated in a mixture of crushed garlic, pineapple juice, Knorr Liquid Seasoning, sugar, and pepper. The marinade provides flavor to the meat when absorbed completely. It is best to marinate overnight or longer for best results.
        
        I am using pineapple juice for this recipe because it provides the right amount of sourness to the beef. This is essential for a successful beef tapa, in my opinion. In addition, pineapple juice is a known meat tenderizer. This means that it tenderizes the meat while providing flavors into it.
        
        Cooking beef tapa involves two methods for this recipe. The first method is boiling. Beef is boiled in its marinade with the addition of water in order to make it tender. Cooking oil is added in the process. Once the liquid completely evaporates, the beef gets fried in the remaining oil. Frying using the remaining oil completes the beef tapa.

        Making garlic fried rice or sinangag is easier than you think. It involves four ingredients, leftover rice, salt, garlic, and cooking oil. It is ideal to use leftover rice because it is less likely to stick with each other. The more garlic, the better, as far as I am concerned.
        
        Start cooking the rice by first browning the garlic. You can put oil and garlic in the pan at the same time and cook until the garlic turns light brown. Add half of the rice and then stir fry. This will give you enough room to blend the garlic and rice. Add remaining rice afterwards and continue to stir fry until well blended. Season with salt.

        The easiest to cook among the three components is the egg. Fry the eggs based on your preference. You may also want to check other ways in cooking eggs.
        
        Assemble your Tapsilog by combining all three components together in a large plate. Serve with spicy vinegar as dipping sauce. Banana ketchup is also nice to have with the egg.`,

From the sour sinigang to the sweet tinola, there’s guaranteed to be a soup dish for every flavor palate preference –– all great to sip and enjoy, especially during long, cool nights. But one of the most popular, and arguably most delicious, soups out there, is the classic Bulalo, or beef shank stew.
        
        One might classify bulalo as a kind of nilaga –– after all, there doesn’t seem to be much difference in ingredients, nor in the cooking process. But what sets bulalo apart is the very specific choice of meat we use for it. The star of a great bulalo is always the meat –– more specifically, the use of beef shank, with marrow still inside the bone. The meat of bulalo is famous for melting in your mouth, practically falling off the bone with how tender it becomes! Doesn’t the mere thought of it make your mouth water?
        
        Bulalo may only have a few ingredients, but it takes an awful lot of patience to prepare. This is only because you have to wait for the beef to reach optimal tenderness. In this recipe, we let our bulalo sit and boil for about an hour and a half. If you have a pressure cooker it should take less time, but still a while, compared to other dishes. In fact, one and a half hours might still be short compared to other recipes, which let the bulalo simmer for much longer.
        
        The other ingredients of bulalo are also delicious and nutritious contributions; cabbage, pechay, corn and onions are also typical ingredients in this great dish. You can also choose to add in fish sauce or patis as a substitution for salt.
        
        Because it’s such a classic dish, there have been many variations of bulalo made by Filipinos, making this humble and already delicious dish more exciting! If you’re a fan of the classic kare-kare, my Bulalo Kare-Kare gives you the best of both worlds, combining delicious beef shank with the trademark peanut sauce. Even more different from the classic recipe is this Deep Fried Bulalo with Teriyaki Sauce! By coating the beef shank in breadcrumbs, eggs and flour, you create a dish crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. With restaurant style teriyaki sauce on the side, it makes for an amazing, yummy meal –– a great twist on a Filipino favorite!
        
        Without question, Bulalo is a quintessential comfort food. It’s no wonder so many restaurants –– bulalohans –– have dedicated themselves to making bulalo their trademark dish. But now you won’t even have to go far to enjoy this meal; with this easy recipe, you can have Bulalo any time you’re craving the comfort of home.`,

        title: `A Step by Step Guide to Making Bulalo`,
        content: `The steps to making Bulalo are simple, albeit quite long because of the tenderizing process. Nonetheless, you should be able to follow this beef shank stew with ease!

        An optional precursor step to making bulalo is blanching your meat to avoid excess fat and sediments. Boil your beef shanks in water over medium heat, skimming the excess fats and scum that accumulate and float on the water. After 10 minutes, take your beef out and bring it under cold running water, “cleaning” it. Once you’ve removed the excess sediments and thrown out the used water, you can now start officially cooking your bulalo
        
        Pour 34 ounces (or about a liter) of water into a large cooking pot, bringing it to a boil. Once it starts boiling, it’s time to put in your beef shank, followed by your medium sized onion and peppercorn. If you’re using a pot, let the meat simmer for about an hour and a half. But for a pressure cooker you’ll only need about half an hour. Let your meat tenderize.
        
        Add in your corn. For this recipe I use 3 whole corns, but cut it up into 3 parts each for convenience. Keep the bulalo simmering for another 10 minutes. After your 10 minutes are up, you can now add in your other vegetables: your cabbage, pechay, and green onion (or onion leeks). This is when you can also add in 2 tablespoons of patis, but again, this is an optional step.
        
        Once you’ve fully cooked your vegetables, you’re ready to eat your bulalo! Serve it hot and share it with your family and friends. With a steaming cup of rice to pour your soup over, it’s definitely an awesome, unforgettable meal!`,

It can consist of various chicken cuts and internal organs cooked in a flavorful broth alongside green papaya and chili pepper or malunggay leaves. The broth is usually generously seasoned with ginger, garlic, and fish sauce, and the soup is often served over plain white rice.

    Chicken tinola is a staple in every Filipino household and can be enjoyed as a starter or a hearty main course.`,

        content: `Excellent source of protein – Our muscles rely on amino acids in order to build, repair, and develop. Protein is composed of amino acids. This means that eating high protein food such as chicken can help keep our muscles healthy.

        Protein is important for our babies and kids. They need it to support growth and physical development. Eating more protein together with soup plus with added vegetables like malunggay, will help moms produce more milk resulting to a healthier breastfeeding. Whenever there is a new mommy in our clan, my aunts will always tell them to eat malunggay because it can help increase breast milk production.
        
        Source of Vitamin B3 – Vitamin B3 keeps our body healthy by improving cholesterol levels. It can also help improve our cardiovascular health. This means that it is good for the heart.`,

This is done by marinating chicken pieces in a unique blend of spices and grilling them until done. Sounds like a simple grilled chicken recipe, isn’t it? Well, it might sound like one; however, the special marinade and basting sauce makes this Ilonggo version of the grilled chicken extra special.`,

    description: `In its simplest form, bibingka is a simple Filipino cake that consists of rice flour and water. It was initially prepared in clay pots that were lined with banana leaves, which would impart a distinctive, smoky flavor to the dish. Bibinka is believed to have appeared under the foreign culinary influence, and the first written reference describing a similar cake dates back to 1751.

    Through history, bibinka was adapted with additional ingredients, and nowadays it is typically prepared with milk, eggs, coconut milk, sugar, and butter, while modern variations may include anything from grated cheese, salted duck eggs or grated coconut, and a variety of different sweet and savory toppings.
    
    This original Filipino delicacy is usually associated with Christmastime, and it is traditionally enjoyed after the mass on Christmas Day. Bibingka is also often served for breakfast.`,

        title: `How to Cook Bibingka`,
        content: `The first step to cooking bibingka is to preheat your oven at 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Combine your dry ingredients together in one bowl: rice flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix them well, and set them aside.

        Now it’s time to cream your butter. Creaming refers to the process of making a soft fat light and fluffy. To do this, beat your butter with a whisk while gradually adding in sugar. This gives your butter a creamier, almost whipped cream-like texture. The sweet smell of butter and sugar is impossible to resist!
        
        Crack your 3 pieces of raw egg and whisk again, until you’ve incorporated all of the ingredients. Once done, it’s now time to combine them with your dry ingredients; add them to the same bowl, and keep mixing. Then, pour in your coconut milk and fresh milk. You need 1 cup of the former, while just ¼ cup of fresh milk will do. Whisk all of your ingredients together for a minute or two more.

        It’s now time to prepare your bibingka for its first round in the oven. Arrange your pre-cut banana leaf on a cake or baking pan. The leaf should be wide enough to cover not only the bottom of the pan, but also the sides. Pour the mixture onto the leaf-coated pan and put it in the oven, letting it bake for 15 minutes.
        
        Once your timer is up, remove your bibingka from the oven. Doesn’t that smell absolutely delicious? The use of a banana leaf also lends to the fragrant aroma. But at this point your bibingka isn’t quite ready to be eaten yet. Top your rice cake with sliced salted egg and grated cheese. At this point in time, your oven should still be kept on –– you’ll still need to use it!

        With its new coat of toppings, put the bibingka back in the oven. Let it bake for another 15 to 20 minutes –– or, wait until the top of your rice cake turns a medium brown. Whichever comes first, remove it from the oven afterwards and let it cool.

        Brush your bibingka with butter and sprinkle sugar on top. If you’re more of a coconut fan, you can opt to top it with that instead of sugar. And just like that, your bibingka is ready to be enjoyed!`,
