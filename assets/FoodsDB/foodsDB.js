The latter refers to cuts with bones intact. These are either pork neck bones, chopped spare ribs, and chopped baby back ribs. Pork shoulder and ham can also be used when cooking sinigang.',

Many meals, both in childhood and adulthood, have been spent sitting in front of the familiarly flavorful broth. Its inviting aroma belies a flavor unlike no other — tart, savory, and refreshing, one can’t help but fall in love with it! With many heralding it as the national Filipino food, it comes as no surprise that its reputation has spread far and wide across the world.

//         Indeed, in 2021, travel guide TasteAtlas proclaimed our humble dish to be the best vegetable soup in the world! This should come as no surprise to us, either. After all, who can resist the warmth and comfort that a bowl of sinigang brings? Although a staple so common in every household, knowing that sinigang will be the main course of the day can’t help but elicit feelings of excitement and delight. No matter the weather nor the season, sinigang stands both the test of time and climate. This dish brings pleasure wherever it finds a home, and Filipinos continue to relish in its sour, but yummy taste.`

//         content: `A mix of tender meat, fresh spinach, string beans, and tomatoes, as well as a dash (or more) of savory fish sauce, make for the perfect combination in simmering and incorporating each unique flavor with each other. Powerful and poignant, sinigang is a Filipino native, through and through. Its name, sinigang, originates from the Tagalog verb that directly translates to “to stew” — sigang! Because of its Tagalog name, many presume it to be Tagalog in origin as well. This yummy meal has relatives in other regions in the country as well, to be sure — yet none are quite like this classic soup that many have fallen in love with.

//         Again, sinigang isn’t a dish so much as it is a cooking method. This is why, like we mentioned earlier, there are a wide number of variations of this delicious dish! These include your sinigang na hipon, a favorite seafood variant. Here, tender and fresh shrimp soak up all the vibrant flavors of your beloved stew. It’s important to keep your shrimp perfectly cooked, so it’s much easier to peel the skin off later on. 
        
//         And for something a little more out of the box? Try this sinigang mix inasal na manok! Now, these are two dishes you wouldn’t commonly associate with each other. But the thrilling flavors of a sinigang broth, coupled with the smoky taste of inasal, makes this a winning combination. This twist on another Filipino favorite breathes life into your everyday inasal recipe. Sample it for yourself!

Saute the onion until it gets soft. Add the sliced pork. We are using pork belly (or liempo) for this recipe. You may also use other pork slices such as shoulders or parts with bones. Add some fish sauce and continue to cook until the pork turns light brown.

//         It is time to add the liquid. This recipe calls for water. You may want to use half water and half beef broth if you prefer your sinigang to be really flavorful. Let the liquid boil and then add the tomato and taro (gabi). The tomato needs to blend in with the broth while the taro will need to cook for a longer time so that it will start to release starch that will make the soup thicker.
        
//         The souring agent for this recipe is a tamarind soup base mix, which is more popularly known as  sinigang mix. This is a quicker alternative to fresh tamarind and it will save you time. Add the mix once meat is tender. Add some long green chili, if desired. This will make your soup spicy good. Add the rest of the vegetables towards the last few minutes. Make sure to add the spinach last.

//         Sinigang mix is a powdered product that helps bring-in that good sour taste to sinigang. Old school methods requires boiling either fresh young tamarind or bilimbi for a long time until the flavors are extracted. It is your choice. It is a no-brainer, so I chose flavor and convenience.`

//         Onion and tomato brings-in flavor to the broth. Cook it during the initial steps. Some people like their tomato intact. If you are one of these people, I suggest to cook half of the tomato initially and add the remaining once the dish is almost done.

//         You can still make sinigang even without all the vegetable in the list. All you need is pork, green leafy veggies, and the souring agent. Of course, water is essential for this recipe.

//         Busy people can use a slow cooker to cook sinigang. Make sure to add the spinach or kangkong only when you are about to eat. It is best to have these fresh.`

Regardless, some dishes may also rise to the challenge of national dish, and have separate camps of their own! Let’s take a look at some of them now.

//         For starters, of course, you have sinigang’s topmost competition: adobo! Point blank, adobo is perhaps sinigang’s antithesis: where the latter is sour and tart and soupy, adobo is a salty, savory and saucy dish. The only thing they have in common is their use of juicy and tender pork belly as the main protein. Like sinigang, the term adobo refers to a general cooking method, and not necessarily one particular meal. To adobo something means to marinate it in a combination of soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, and peppercorn. These flavors intermingle so perfectly, you wouldn’t be able to tell one from the other. The result is, to be sure, a dish that is so umami you’d want to drizzle the sauce over your entire plate of rice!`

        title: 'How to Cook Pancit Canton',
        content: `Here is a summary of what I did to achieve this delicious and tasty pancit canton.

        I started by preparing the vegetables. Blanch the snap peas, carrot, and cabbage. Blanching is a cooking method that retains the texture and color of vegetables. Do this by first preparing a large bowl that can accomodate all the vegetables. Fill half of it with cold water and add ice. Set the bowl aside. Meanwhile boil water on a cooking pot and put all the veggies in there. Boil for less than a minute (around 50 seconds) and then transfer the veggies to the bowl with ice water. The temperature of the water stops the vegetable from cooking further.This helps make the veggies crisp and retain its color. Set the vegetables aside. These will be added back towards the end of the process.
        
        Saute onion and garlic until soft. Add the meat and continue to cook until the color turns light brown. You can add seasonings and chicken broth. Let boil and continue to cook with the pot covered until the meats are tender.

        The shrimp and chopped parsley goes next. These cooks quickly. Add the noodles afterwards and cover the pot. Let the noodles absorb the steam. This makes it softer. Toss the noodles and continue to cook until the liquid is completely absorbed. You may want to add more water if the noodles seem dry.

        Finish it by adding back the blanched vegetables and seasoning with ground black pepper. Toss until all ingredients are well distributed.`,

        You can use snow peas a a substitute for snap peas. These are called chicharo in Filipino.
        
        • Chicken can also be a good alternative to pork.
        • The oyster sauce is an optional ingredient. I like it because it improves the flavor of pancit canton.
        • Sliced long green beans can be added to the dish.
        • Napa cabbage can be used as an alternative ingredient to regular cabbage.`,

        content: `Vegetarian – This version is vegetarian and vegan friendly. It had the basic ingredients with the addition of Shiitake mushroom. This is a flavorful mushroom variety that I used most of the time when cooking Asian dishes.
        
        Instant – There was a time when instant pancit canton was a staple because of its price and ease of preparation. However, this is not the healthiest food that you can make for yourself or your family. I developed this recipe to introduce a healthier instant pancit canton by adding vegetables.

        Shrimp – I like to have shrimp in my doodle dish. It provides a good flavor and is always pleasant to eat. This particular version makes use of frozen shrimp along with bell peppers. It is one of my go to recipe when I feel like making a quick one with limited time.

        Shrimp and Chicken – A combination of shrimp and chicken for a noodle dish is always a good idea. This recipe has shredded chicken and pan-fried shrimp. I also had some Chinese sausage in it to lift the overall flavor to the next level.

        Squid Ball – Chow mein with squid ball is a budget-friendly dish. It is composed of the same flour noodles with vegetables such as cabbage and carrots. A popular Filipino street food known as squid balls are utilized. A squid ball is a ball-shaped mixture with either fresh chopped squid or squid flavor.

        Seafood – One of my favorite version is seafood. It has shrimp, squid, crabmeat, squiballs, and mushroom. I think that this is one of the tastiest noodle dish that I made. It is perfect during lent when Catholics are abstaining from meat.

        Saucy – Pancit canton with extra sauce is always good to have. There are even times when I eat it with rice. It might sound unusual, but the flavorful sauce always complement whatever dish or side dish you eat it with. I like mine with more calamansi, so I squeeze a piece of it over the pancit before eating.

        Pancit Canton and Bihon – another version of pancit canton that is famous in Cebu and its nearby provinces is called Bam-I. It is a combination of both flour sticks and rice stick noodles. Any topping ingredient can be used to make this version. The key here to be able to cook both noodles properly and distribute it evenly to make the dish look good.`,

        Calamansi or calamondin is a citrus fruit. It is smaller than lime and has a sour and a bit bitter taste. Lemon and lime can also be used a substitutes when calamansi is not available.

It has become so popular that one of our most frequented fast food chains, Jollibee, has taken it as one of their offerings!`,

        title: 'What is a Pancit Palabok',
        content: `Pancit Palabok is a variation of pancit, a classic dish many Filipinos enjoy. Despite the many different kinds of pancit in the country, palabok is easily recognized by certain trademark characteristics: its thin noodles and orange sauce in particular. Some say that one synonym of palabok is “salsa na malapot” –– meaning, a sauce that is gooey and viscous in nature.
        
        However, the orange color of palabok’s sauce doesn’t come from the orange fruit; instead, palabok sauce is usually a combination of pork broth, shrimp cubes, ground pork, and annatto powder. The latter is the reason behind these noodles’ bright and refreshing appearance.

        Aside from its appearance, what sets pancit palabok apart from other popular pancit variations? Let’s find out.`,
      },
      {
        title: 'What is the difference between Pancit Malabon and Palabok?',
        content: `Tasty and true to its name, Pancit Malabon hails from –– you guessed it –– the city of Malabon! Its bright appearance bears a resemblance to that of Pancit Palabok; the use of hard boiled eggs, chicharon, and shrimp, too, cannot be discounted. Many people consider Pancit Palabok and Pancit Malabon to be one and the same because of this.

        However, one of the biggest differences lies in the type of noodles we use in each kind of pancit. In Pancit Palabok, the noodles are much thinner. The typical noodle of choice is bihon, which are almost clear in nature and known for their narrowness. Meanwhile, Malabon’s noodles are considerably thicker.
        
        Another difference is the toppings. Pancit Malabon tends to use more seafood, like shrimp, squid –– even oysters at times! While palabok has shrimps, too, that’s typically as far as seafood toppings go for this kind of pancit. When serving palabok, one usually only puts the toppings and sauce atop the noodles instead of mixing them. With Pancit Malabon, on the other hand, the ingredients, toppings, and sauce are more incorporated.`,
      },
      {
        title: 'What makes Pancit Malabon different from Pancit Luglug?',
        content: `Essentially, Pancit Luglug is just the Kapampangan version of Pancit Palabok. From the toppings all the way down to its special sauce, Luglug looks even more similar to Palabok than Pancia Malabon does.

        However, the difference, once again, is in the noodles! Luglug is actually a term that refers specifically to the method of cooking thick rice noodles. While some say that you can make pancit luglug with both thick or thin noodles, it is more common to use the former rather than the latter.`,
      },
      {
        title: 'How to Cook Pancit Palabok',
        content: `Making Pancit Palabok is usually divided into two portions: making the sauce and making the toppings. Altogether, cooking and prep time shouldn’t take longer than 45 minutes! In no time at all, you’ll have enough Pancit Palabok to feed your whole family. 

        Your sauce ingredients don’t require a lot of preparation beforehand, but your toppings sure do. Boil 1 cup of pork, then thinly slice and cut it into small pieces. Cube 2 pieces of fried firm tofu, pound half a cup of chicharon, and slice 2 hard boiled eggs. Don’t forget to boil or steam your shrimp (about half a cup) then finely chop your green onions or scallions.
        
        All ready? Let’s start cooking! Soak 1 pack of rice noodles in water for about 15 minutes. Afterwards, drain them and set it aside. We’ll be focusing on the sauce portion of your pancit palabok first; begin by heating some cooking oil in a saucepan. Once your oil is hot enough, pour in half a pound of ground pork, letting it cook for about 5 to 7 minutes. 
        
        Take your tablespoon of annatto powder and dilute it in 3 cups of pork broth. If you’re using annatto seeds, it’s important to soak them first in 3 tablespoons of water to bring out the palabok’s trademark color. Pour this mixture into a saucepan and bring it to a boil. Add your shrimp cube and stir, letting the sauce simmer for about 3 minutes. Little by little, pour in, too, your 6 tablespoons of all purpose flour. Stir your pancit palabok sauce gradually as you do so. Add 2 tablespoons of fish sauce and half a teaspoon of ground black pepper and let your sauce simmer until it becomes thick. Once it has, turn the heat off and set it aside. 
        
        With your sauce out of the way, let’s now prepare the rest of your pancit! Boil enough water in a pot. Then, take your noodles and put them in a strainer (metal or bamboo), then submerge said strainer in the boiling water. This should only take about a minute or so, until the noodles are cooked. Remove the strainer from the pot, and drain the remaining water.
        
        Now it’s time to prepare your pancit palabok serving plate! Place the noodles first before pouring the sauce over them thoroughly. Arrange your toppings –- your tofu, your chicharon, your shrimp, eggs, and others –– around the plate, and over the sauce. Last but not the least, give your pancit palabok that zesty flavor with a slice of lemon or calamansi.`,

        title: `How to Cook Sisig`,
        content: `Start to cook sisig by boiling the meat. I boiled the pork belly and maskara for 1 hour in medium heat. The meat needs to be tenderized so that it will be easier to chop later on.

        I also grill the meat after boiling. This will give it a good texture. There are no marinades or rubs needed here. Simply put the boiled pork belly and maskara on a hot grill, and then grill each side for 5 minutes or until is starts to darken.
        
        It is chopping time at this point. Simply chop the belly and pig face into small pieces. I use a knife known as a cleaver to assist me in this step. It weighs heavy enough and has a sharp cutting edge that helps me chop easily. The size of the chopped pork will depend on your preference. You can go a bit bigger or chop it as fine as it can get depending on your preference. Set the meat aside after this step. It is time to cook it on the stovetop.

        I started by sautéing the onions. Chicken livers were added afterwards. These steps can be interchanged just so you know. Let me explain. Chicken liver is an essential ingredient for my sisig recipes. It provides a good amount of flavor to the dish. These can be chopped or sliced into smaller pieces before cooking. I am just not used in doing that, but you can. What I do is to cook it thoroughly and mash it right on the pan while cooking. These livers are easier to mash when thoroughly cooked, unlike pork or beef liver, which tend to get tougher. You can fry the chicken liver first until cooked all throughout. This will usually take 5 minutes. The other option is to do it as this recipe suggest. An easier option for beginners would be to chop the livers into small pieces before cooking. This makes mashing it easier.

        Add the chopped pork into the mix. These do not need to cook long. Give it a nice stir for around 3 minutes just to ensure that all ingredients in the pan are distributed evenly. Add seasonings and spices afterwards. You have the option to add chili flakes at this point. Note that I am using Knorr Liquid Seasoning to provide additional flavor to the dish. It can provide a good amount of flavor compared to regular soy sauce.

        The final texture of sisig is somewhat mushy. Pig brains are added into the mixture in traditional recipes to obtain this. Good news! There are alternative ingredients. Mayonnaise is one. This is what I used in this recipe.
        
        A good way to present sisig is to put it on a metal plate and serve while sizzling. This makes the dish more appetizing to the eye. This is optional.`,

        title: `Alternative Ingredients`,
        content: `Pig face and ears are the traditional ingredients for sisig. This recipe is using an alternative ingredient in the form of pork belly. Pork shoulders can also be used in this recipe.

        Chicken sisig is a good version that can be made using this recipe. Substitute chopped chicken thighs for the pork. Make sure that the chicken was boiled the same way before chopping it.
        
        Fish sisig and tofu sisig are versions of the dish that are done differently. These can be good alternative dishes for non-pork eaters.`,

    A dish that is classically and quintessentially Pinoy, chicken adobo is a dish that is beloved by many across the country. While there have been several variations of adobo across the years, chicken adobo remains one of the most popular –– and for good reason!

    The taste of juicy chicken in a succulent, umami adobo sauce makes chicken adobo a comfort food for all ages. From kids to adults, we can’t get enough of this mouthwatering meal!`,

        title: `What is Chicken Adobo`,
        content: `A dish and cooking process native to the Philippines, adobo refers to the method of marinating meat, seafood, or vegetables (pretty much anything!) in a combination of soy sauce and vinegar. This marinade also includes other herbs and flavorings like garlic, bay leaves, and whole peppercorns.

        Cooking food in vinegar is no foreign concept to us Filipinos. In pre-colonial times, our ancestors used to cook seafood in vinegar in order to preserve their freshness. Many regard adobo as a spin on kinilaw, which is another traditional cooking method. Kinilaw refers mainly to cooking raw seafood in vinegar and spices. Another similar process is paksiw, which utilizes meat broth in vinegar and spices.
        
        What really sets adobo apart is the presence of soy sauce in its marinade. While vinegar has a pungent aroma and a very distinctly sour taste, soy sauce is on both the sweeter and saltier side. A staple in any Asian household, soy sauce (or toyo) definitely helps in bringing out chicken adobo’s savory taste.

        (Here’s a fun fact: did you know that there are different kinds of soy sauce? In Japan especially, there are five different kinds of soy sauce that each have their own unique flavors and uses. The most common one you’ll find in markets is dark soy sauce, or koikuchi. With a deeper color than most other types, dark soy sauce is packed with flavor –– perfect for your chicken adobo!)

        Adobo also contains dry bay leaves in its recipe. Although you aren’t to eat them whole, bay leaves lend their subtle, deep flavors to this umami dish. It may not be the star of the show, but your chicken adobo wouldn’t be complete without it. However, you can choose to substitute this herb with basil if you can’t find it at stores.`,
      },
      {
        title: `Chicken Adobo Origin`,
        content: `The famous Chicken Adobo originated in the Philippines. The dish is prepared using the Inadobo style of cooking. It means cooking meat or seafood with vinegar and mostly soy sauce. It is a popular method during the olden days when refrigerators and freezers were not yet available because vinegar helps extend the shelf life of food. Another popular variation is pork adobo using pork belly.`,
      },
      {
        title: `How to Cook Chicken Adobo`,
        content: `Cooking Chicken Adobo is quick and simple. This recipe suggests marinating the chicken to make it more flavorful. It is the best way to go if you want to experience authentic Filipino chicken adobo. If you are in a hurry, feel free to skip this step, but make sure to simmer the chicken longer than 30 minutes to better extract the flavors from it.
        
        Start by marinating the chicken in soy sauce and garlic. The garlic needs to be crushed for best results. This process takes 1 hour to 12 hours depending on how flavorful you want the dish to be. Sometimes marinating for an hour is not enough. I think that 3 hours is optimal. The chicken absorbs most of the flavors from the soy sauce and garlic during this step. It is noticeable when you taste the dish after cooking. Note that it is also possible to include the vinegar in this step.
        
        The next step is to separate the chicken from the marinade. Make sure to set the marinade aside because it will be used later on. Pan-fry the chicken pieces for 1 to 1 ½ minutes per side. This will partially cook the outer part. It also makes the skin tough enough to withstand stewing later. This means that it will remain intact, which is nice for presentation.

        Pour marinade into the pot and add water. Let boil. The bay leaves and whole peppercorn can now be added. The process takes 20 to 25 minutes depending on the quality of the chicken. However, feel free to cook longer in low heat for a super tender chicken adobo.

        Add the vinegar. This can also be added as a part of the marinade. Let it cook for 10 minutes and then add sugar and salt. I only add salt if needed. It is important to taste your dish before adding seasonings.

        Filipino chicken adobo can be served with or without sauce. If you like it very tasty then continue to cook on an uncovered cooking pot until the liquid completely evaporates.`,
