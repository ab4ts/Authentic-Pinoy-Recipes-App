Beef, shrimp, fish are commonly used to cook sinigang. The chicken version, on the other hand, is called sinampalukang manok. I prefer to use either pork belly or buto-buto when cooking sinigang. The latter refers to cuts with bones intact. These are either pork neck bones, chopped spare ribs, and chopped baby back ribs. Pork shoulder and ham can also be used when cooking sinigang.',

Many meals, both in childhood and adulthood, have been spent sitting in front of the familiarly flavorful broth. Its inviting aroma belies a flavor unlike no other — tart, savory, and refreshing, one can’t help but fall in love with it! With many heralding it as the national Filipino food, it comes as no surprise that its reputation has spread far and wide across the world.

//         Indeed, in 2021, travel guide TasteAtlas proclaimed our humble dish to be the best vegetable soup in the world! This should come as no surprise to us, either. After all, who can resist the warmth and comfort that a bowl of sinigang brings? Although a staple so common in every household, knowing that sinigang will be the main course of the day can’t help but elicit feelings of excitement and delight. No matter the weather nor the season, sinigang stands both the test of time and climate. This dish brings pleasure wherever it finds a home, and Filipinos continue to relish in its sour, but yummy taste.`

//         content: `A mix of tender meat, fresh spinach, string beans, and tomatoes, as well as a dash (or more) of savory fish sauce, make for the perfect combination in simmering and incorporating each unique flavor with each other. Powerful and poignant, sinigang is a Filipino native, through and through. Its name, sinigang, originates from the Tagalog verb that directly translates to “to stew” — sigang! Because of its Tagalog name, many presume it to be Tagalog in origin as well. This yummy meal has relatives in other regions in the country as well, to be sure — yet none are quite like this classic soup that many have fallen in love with.

//         Again, sinigang isn’t a dish so much as it is a cooking method. This is why, like we mentioned earlier, there are a wide number of variations of this delicious dish! These include your sinigang na hipon, a favorite seafood variant. Here, tender and fresh shrimp soak up all the vibrant flavors of your beloved stew. It’s important to keep your shrimp perfectly cooked, so it’s much easier to peel the skin off later on. 
        
//         And for something a little more out of the box? Try this sinigang mix inasal na manok! Now, these are two dishes you wouldn’t commonly associate with each other. But the thrilling flavors of a sinigang broth, coupled with the smoky taste of inasal, makes this a winning combination. This twist on another Filipino favorite breathes life into your everyday inasal recipe. Sample it for yourself!

Saute the onion until it gets soft. Add the sliced pork. We are using pork belly (or liempo) for this recipe. You may also use other pork slices such as shoulders or parts with bones. Add some fish sauce and continue to cook until the pork turns light brown.

//         It is time to add the liquid. This recipe calls for water. You may want to use half water and half beef broth if you prefer your sinigang to be really flavorful. Let the liquid boil and then add the tomato and taro (gabi). The tomato needs to blend in with the broth while the taro will need to cook for a longer time so that it will start to release starch that will make the soup thicker.
        
//         The souring agent for this recipe is a tamarind soup base mix, which is more popularly known as  sinigang mix. This is a quicker alternative to fresh tamarind and it will save you time. Add the mix once meat is tender. Add some long green chili, if desired. This will make your soup spicy good. Add the rest of the vegetables towards the last few minutes. Make sure to add the spinach last.

//         Sinigang mix is a powdered product that helps bring-in that good sour taste to sinigang. Old school methods requires boiling either fresh young tamarind or bilimbi for a long time until the flavors are extracted. It is your choice. It is a no-brainer, so I chose flavor and convenience.`

//         Onion and tomato brings-in flavor to the broth. Cook it during the initial steps. Some people like their tomato intact. If you are one of these people, I suggest to cook half of the tomato initially and add the remaining once the dish is almost done.

//         You can still make sinigang even without all the vegetable in the list. All you need is pork, green leafy veggies, and the souring agent. Of course, water is essential for this recipe.

//         Busy people can use a slow cooker to cook sinigang. Make sure to add the spinach or kangkong only when you are about to eat. It is best to have these fresh.`

Regardless, some dishes may also rise to the challenge of national dish, and have separate camps of their own! Let’s take a look at some of them now.

//         For starters, of course, you have sinigang’s topmost competition: adobo! Point blank, adobo is perhaps sinigang’s antithesis: where the latter is sour and tart and soupy, adobo is a salty, savory and saucy dish. The only thing they have in common is their use of juicy and tender pork belly as the main protein. Like sinigang, the term adobo refers to a general cooking method, and not necessarily one particular meal. To adobo something means to marinate it in a combination of soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, and peppercorn. These flavors intermingle so perfectly, you wouldn’t be able to tell one from the other. The result is, to be sure, a dish that is so umami you’d want to drizzle the sauce over your entire plate of rice!`

It is prepared using a variety of ingredients, which makes it look festive. There is also a combination of different flavors that make it delicious.
    
    This Pancit Canton Recipe makes use of sliced pork, sausage, and shrimp. It also utilizes different kinds of vegetables. I always like to make my noodle dish this way because I believe that food should be both pleasing to the eyes and the palate at the same time.

    Have you tried cooking pancit canton? If not, that’s okay. I am here to guide you. This recipe post and the accompanying video below will help you get started. You will be all set as long as you follow the directions step by step.`,

        title: 'How to Cook Pancit Canton',
        content: `Here is a summary of what I did to achieve this delicious and tasty pancit canton.

        I started by preparing the vegetables. Blanch the snap peas, carrot, and cabbage. Blanching is a cooking method that retains the texture and color of vegetables. Do this by first preparing a large bowl that can accomodate all the vegetables. Fill half of it with cold water and add ice. Set the bowl aside. Meanwhile boil water on a cooking pot and put all the veggies in there. Boil for less than a minute (around 50 seconds) and then transfer the veggies to the bowl with ice water. The temperature of the water stops the vegetable from cooking further.This helps make the veggies crisp and retain its color. Set the vegetables aside. These will be added back towards the end of the process.
        
        Saute onion and garlic until soft. Add the meat and continue to cook until the color turns light brown. You can add seasonings and chicken broth. Let boil and continue to cook with the pot covered until the meats are tender.

        The shrimp and chopped parsley goes next. These cooks quickly. Add the noodles afterwards and cover the pot. Let the noodles absorb the steam. This makes it softer. Toss the noodles and continue to cook until the liquid is completely absorbed. You may want to add more water if the noodles seem dry.

        Finish it by adding back the blanched vegetables and seasoning with ground black pepper. Toss until all ingredients are well distributed.`

        content: `There are many ways to cook pancit canton. The difference between each version has something to do with the main ingredients used.

        You can use snow peas a a substitute for snap peas. These are called chicharo in Filipino.
        
        • Chicken can also be a good alternative to pork.
        • The oyster sauce is an optional ingredient. I like it because it improves the flavor of pancit canton.
        • Sliced long green beans can be added to the dish.
        • Napa cabbage can be used as an alternative ingredient to regular cabbage.`

        title: 'Pancit Canton Versions',
        content: `Vegetarian – This version is vegetarian and vegan friendly. It had the basic ingredients with the addition of Shiitake mushroom. This is a flavorful mushroom variety that I used most of the time when cooking Asian dishes.
        
        Instant – There was a time when instant pancit canton was a staple because of its price and ease of preparation. However, this is not the healthiest food that you can make for yourself or your family. I developed this recipe to introduce a healthier instant pancit canton by adding vegetables.

        Shrimp – I like to have shrimp in my doodle dish. It provides a good flavor and is always pleasant to eat. This particular version makes use of frozen shrimp along with bell peppers. It is one of my go to recipe when I feel like making a quick one with limited time.

        Shrimp and Chicken – A combination of shrimp and chicken for a noodle dish is always a good idea. This recipe has shredded chicken and pan-fried shrimp. I also had some Chinese sausage in it to lift the overall flavor to the next level.

        Squid Ball – Chow mein with squid ball is a budget-friendly dish. It is composed of the same flour noodles with vegetables such as cabbage and carrots. A popular Filipino street food known as squid balls are utilized. A squid ball is a ball-shaped mixture with either fresh chopped squid or squid flavor.

        Seafood – One of my favorite version is seafood. It has shrimp, squid, crabmeat, squiballs, and mushroom. I think that this is one of the tastiest noodle dish that I made. It is perfect during lent when Catholics are abstaining from meat.

        Saucy – Pancit canton with extra sauce is always good to have. There are even times when I eat it with rice. It might sound unusual, but the flavorful sauce always complement whatever dish or side dish you eat it with. I like mine with more calamansi, so I squeeze a piece of it over the pancit before eating.

        Pancit Canton and Bihon – another version of pancit canton that is famous in Cebu and its nearby provinces is called Bam-I. It is a combination of both flour sticks and rice stick noodles. Any topping ingredient can be used to make this version. The key here to be able to cook both noodles properly and distribute it evenly to make the dish look good.`

        title: 'What is the Best Condiment for Pancit Canton?',
        content: `The best condiment for pancit canton for me is a mixture composed of soy sauce and calamansi. It is also known as “toyomansi”.

        Calamansi or calamondin is a citrus fruit. It is smaller than lime and has a sour and a bit bitter taste. Lemon and lime can also be used a substitutes when calamansi is not available.
        
        Simply pour a tablespoons or two of toyomansi on your noodle dish and toss until well blended. Yummy!`
